When using Google Maps or something similar, it is possible to enter many different routes and be able to get an estimation of how much time that trip would take. However, we have found that it would be incredibly useful to know, based on traffic conditions and if there was no need to go to certain locations in an order, what the most efficient route would be. Google Maps also maintains the ability to send directions to your phone, but we thought it would be incredibly useful if an app would remember/save recent travel experiences. This would enable, if that trip is used multiple times, for suggestions to be made for the user. For example, if that trip is remembered and the user usually takes that trip at 8:00 AM, the app could then make suggestions, based on traffic history and current conditions.

This application will solve these exact problems as listed above. The application will allow users to save routes and the stops along the route that must occur in specific positions. The software will then suggest the optimal route with those parameters, given the current road and traffic conditions, via an outside technology such as the Google Maps API. We will present our solution to this problem using a modern and responsive user interface and will also use authentication in order to let users reuse past routes in a clean and efficient manner. This project will enable us, the developers, to use their past web development experience while challenging us with new technologies with which they have not previously worked.
